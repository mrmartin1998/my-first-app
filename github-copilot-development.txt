GitHub Issues → Copilot Development Workflow:

## CURRENT PROGRESS:
✅ Created Issue #2: "Add Pokemon-themed Header Component"

Option 1: Manual Issues + Copilot ← CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTING

You create issues on GitHub (like "Add Pokemon-themed header component")
I help you work on those issues in VS Code
We make commits, push to branches, create PRs
Option 2: Automated with GitHub Copilot Chat

Use GitHub Copilot Chat to create issues automatically
Link issues to specific code changes
Automate some of the workflow
Option 3: Full GitHub Actions Integration

Set up GitHub Actions that trigger when issues are created
More advanced but super powerful
